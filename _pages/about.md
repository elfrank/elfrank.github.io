I'm a software engineer with a passion for technical leadership. I enjoy breaking down ill-defined, complex problems, and guiding teams through execution.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:elfrank.ab@gmail.com) if you want to nerd out about Engineering Culture, Software Architecture and Leadership. [What are you up to?](mailto:elfrank.ab@gmail.com)
