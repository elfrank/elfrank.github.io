My first entry in my journal is from January 1st, 2020. One of my goals is writing more and writing better. It is growing on me. This site will be the living proof of my commitment. So I better don't disappoint.

Writing clarifies my ideas. It helps me reflect, not only on what I read but about my life too.

Reading accumulates information. Reflecting assimilates knowledge.

While life has no rewind button, writing gives you a second chance. Writing is playing back your life in the third person. Why did the thing go wrong? How can I do more of the good stuff?

Write more.
