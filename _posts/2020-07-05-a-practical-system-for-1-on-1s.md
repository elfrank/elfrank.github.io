title:  A Practical System for 1-on-1's
categories: [Productivity,Management]
excerpt: 1-on-1s are a crucial component of healthy professional relationships. There are numerous articles only about how to get the best out of 1:1s, which I won't dive into. Instead, I would like to share the system I use to prepare my 1-on-1s. Systems allow us to scale by making repeatable tasks automatic. We, humans, are not designed to remember information. Technology is pretty good at that. So, why not use it?

1-on-1s are a crucial component of healthy professional relationships. There are numerous articles only about how to get the best out of 1:1s, which I won't dive into. Instead, I would like to share the system I use to prepare my 1-on-1s.

Systems allow us to scale by making repeatable tasks automatic.
We, humans, are not designed to remember information.

Technology is pretty good at that. So, why not use it?

### Create a Running Document
Focus on simplicity. I prefer Google Docs, but there are dozens of tools out there. Use what works for you.

There are three important aspects to it:
* Use headings for the dates so that you can navigate quickly to a specific date.
* Keep the most recent session at the top.
* Each session, represented by date, includes action items, and a series of topics to cover.

### Share the Document
1-on-1s are a two-way street. Share the document with the other party. This way, both can add topics you would like to discuss, and both can review topics ahead of time.

In times of shelter in place and remote work, it also makes it easy to share your screen in a video call. In the past, I prepared my 1-on-1's in Apple Notes, but I found that a shared document works better for me (i.e., more comfortable to share screen).

### Link the Document on the Calendar Invite
Make it easy to discover. With so many temporary documents, it comes handy to link relevant documents in a Calendar invite.

It also becomes easier to find for the other person. Just make sure the permission settings are correct.

### Add Topics During the Week
This is probably my favorite part of the system. If I remember something I should discuss with someone, I open the corresponding document, and I add the topic. Then, I forget about it. This process takes less than 30 seconds.

A trick to access documents quickly is to include keywords on the document's title, such as "your name", the "other's person's name" and "1:1s". Start typing the other person's name in the URL bar, and the autocomplete will do the rest.

### Use a TODO app to prepare 1-on-1's the day before
Failing to plan is planning to fail. Prepare your 1-on-1s in advance. Experiment with what works for you, but I recommend planning the session the day before.

Scheduled reminders are awesome. I have a few recurring ones. One of them is a daily "Prepare 1:1s" reminder. There are many options out there to schedule recurring reminders or tasks (I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)). What's most important about reminders is thinking ahead: plan for your future self. You'll thank yourself later.

### Keep a Notebook next to you
Use a notebook to capture thoughts, ideas, or feedback during your day. Make it accessible.

I keep a notebook and pen next to me during my workday. My notebook is full of miscellaneous notes. Most notes come from 1:1 conversations, something important from a meeting, or a sudden thought that I wanted to capture.

Coincidentally, some of the notes are great topics to cover during 1-on-1s. Once a week, I go through my notebook and translate some of them into action items or 1-on-1 topics.
